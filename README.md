##  Overview

**Thikra** is a client-side web application designed to improve film development. Traditional photo studios can charge up to **50 SAR** just to scan and process negatives. We believe you should be able to do this comfortably at home for **free**.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Instant Inversion:** Converts negative film strips (color or B&W) to positive images.
* **Privacy First:** All processing happens in your browser. No images are uploaded to a cloud.
* **Export:** Download your developed photos in high resolution.
